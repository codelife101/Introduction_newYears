            once. The notes are able to be reedemed at all challenges. But to do so 
            a member from your team will have to find Jake to let him know that a note

        <p>By now you will be well aware that there are two sheets 
            of paper on the clip board. One is a sheet which is an activity
            check list. So that you know when all the activities are finished.
            The other is a games sheet. As part of your journey you will need to complete
            all of the puzzels on the sheet as these could potentially hold answers.
            Along the journey you will also find qr codes which will contain clues to unlock treasures so make sure 
            that someone in the group can access these otherwise unlucky uce.

        <p>First challenge does'nt need to much explination. I'm sure
            at some point we have all given this game a nudge. Each team 
            will play a total of three games. The games will be played in pairs.
            Each team cant play two games in a row with the same pair.
            Winning is v important as the more wins you have the sooner you will get to start the next
            challenge. Once your ready press osshhh lessgooo but take notice as you may need somthing that is to follow.
